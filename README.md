# phaser-eric-testing-tiles

This is to try phaser on my own.
I want to get the following done:



TODO 1:
DONE - build cheap tile set with angles
DONE - build a simple level with Tiled
DONE   - create collisiosn in Tiled
DONE   - make spawn point in level with Tiled
DONE - import level into Phaser with collisions
DONE - create slime assets
DONE  - idle
DONE  - walking
DONE  - rising
DONE  - falling
DONE - Import slime into world
DONE  - use a box for collision (roughly the size of the actual slime)
DONE  - slime uses WASD for controls, with animation playing appropriately 
DONE - Camera
DONE  - make camera follow slime around
DONE  - make it so the camera doesn't go off tilemap


TODO 2:
- modify slime
DONE   - modify slime to have a compound body instead of simple body
   - modify slime to "fix" the ghost collision problem
   - modify slime to "fix" the sticky wall problem


TODO 3:
DONE - build a player class
DONE   - create state machine as you did in Unity
DONE   - use old sprite sheet for graphics
