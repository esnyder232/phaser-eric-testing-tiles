# phaser-eric-testing-tiles

This is to try phaser on my own.
I want to get the following done:



TODO 1:
DONE - build cheap tile set with angles
DONE - build a simple level with Tiled
DONE   - create collisiosn in Tiled
DONE   - make spawn point in level with Tiled
DONE - import level into Phaser with collisions
DONE - create slime
DONE  - idle
DONE  - walking
DONE  - rising
DONE  - falling
 - Import slime into world
DONE  - use a box for collision (roughly the size of the actual slime)
  - slime uses WASD for controls, with animation playing appropriately 
- Camera
 - make camera follow slime around
 - make it so the camera doesn't go off tilemap



TODO 2:
 - modify slime
   - modify slime to have a compound body instead of simple body



TODO 3:
 - build a player class
   - create state machine as you did in Unity
   - use old sprite sheet for graphics
